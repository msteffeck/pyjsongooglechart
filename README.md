#### This Project is no longer being developed. 
After building this, I found that Google Charts began accepting a much simpler
JSON format. I'll keep this up on github, though, because it doesn't hurt to leave
it up, and there is some neat code in here. 




pyjsongooglechart
=================

pyjsongooglechart is a simple wrapper around the Google api for Javascript
charts. It is a slightly thicker wrapper than the Python wrapper that Google
provides. It enables the user to easily compile JSON data in the appropriate
format for the charts, without having to worry too much about the structure
of the JSON.


The Basics
----------
This library will provide a wrapper for each of the major Google Javascript
charts.


### Basic Chart
Pie charts are probably the most basic charts; therefore, a good place to start.

```python
from pyjsongooglechart import PieChart

chart = PieChart("Electoral College Votes") # Initialized with the chart title

# Each argument represents a column. Pie charts have two columns; the first for
# the slice label, and the second contains the numeric value.
chart.insert_row("California", 55)
chart.insert_row("Nevada", 5)
chart.insert_row("Texas", 34)

# Renders the above data into a JSON string
json = chart.render_json()
```

Depending on the framework you're using, you'll also need to create
an HTTP response. The following is how you could do it in Django:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

return HttpResponse(json, mimetype="application/json")
```

### Customizations
The PieChart produced by the above code is rather simple. However, we can spruce
it up. Google Charts allows you to change the display text for each row. This
library supports that:

```python
chart.insert_row("Washington", (12, "Twelve"))
chart.insert_row("Maine", (4, "Four"))
```

We can also modify the options of the chart. The following options are all
defined within the Google Charts docs (there are many more):

```python
chart.options.is3D = True
chart.options.legend.position = "left"
chart.options.height = 500
chart.options.width = 600
```
